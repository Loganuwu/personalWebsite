# personalWebsite
Logan Barajas' personal website portfolio that is mobile responsize. 
Last Updated January 13th, 2022.

All bodies of text and boxes have comments under and around them to isolate which parts of the HTML and css are doing what. 
HTML is the main division and bootstrap grid to connect the button to links and adding the text,

CSS is lightly being used to control the fonts and text colorings and the navy backgrounds as well with custom animations all done with css.

I will be updating this website every couple weeks to implement new ideas and different styles learned in class.

--Change log January 13th--
Changed button colors from default green to match the font colors.
added an about me section at the bottom, as long as scroll spy to finally add functionality to clicking on my name in the navbar
added second bootcamp project to the list of projects.

**Need to still add more to the about me, it is very short and could use pictures perhaps, maybe everyday life pictures of me and my hobbies.
